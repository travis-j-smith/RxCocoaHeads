# RxCocoaHeads

This is my sample project demonstrating basic RxSwift and RxCocoa usage for the Nashville CocoaHeads group.  My presentation slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-SIbDfJGqHVDD6CYC48GHj5tTne8-aiSTXcYJoKZe08/edit?usp=sharing).

## Getting Started

To run this app, you’ll need to get an API key from [OMDb API](https://omdbapi.com).  Put the API key in your Info.plist with the key "apiKey".  If you don’t the app will deliberately crash on launch.

## License

MIT sounds good.  Use my code if it helps you.
